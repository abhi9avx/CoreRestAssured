 Sure, Abhinav! Here‚Äôs a clean summary of your MethodChaining class along with a breakdown of how it works:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary of MethodChaining Example

üìå Purpose:

This class demonstrates method chaining ‚Äî a design pattern where multiple method calls are linked together in a single statement, making code more fluent and readable.

‚∏ª

üîç Code Flow Explained:

a1().a2().a3();

	1.	a1() is static, so it‚Äôs called without creating an object:
	‚Ä¢	Prints: "This is a1 method"
	‚Ä¢	Returns a new instance of MethodChaining
	2.	On that returned instance, a2() is called:
	‚Ä¢	Prints: "This is a2 method"
	‚Ä¢	Returns this (the current object)
	3.	Then, a3() is called on the same object:
	‚Ä¢	Prints: "This is a3 method"
	‚Ä¢	Returns this again

‚∏ª

üß† Concepts Demonstrated:

Concept	Explanation
Method Chaining	Calling multiple methods on the same object instance in one line
return this	Returns the current object to allow chaining
Static + Non-static Mix	a1() is static and creates the object, while a2() and a3() are instance methods



‚∏ª

üí° Why It‚Äôs Useful:
	‚Ä¢	Makes code fluent and readable
	‚Ä¢	Common in test automation frameworks (like Rest Assured)
	‚Ä¢	Used in builder patterns for object creation

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to convert this into a real-world example like using RestAssured, or a UserBuilder class to practice further!
